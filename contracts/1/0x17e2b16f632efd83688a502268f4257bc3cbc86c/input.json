The variable tokenSaleContractAddressSetAndMinted should be \"true\"\n\nPlease don't send any funds to this contract, unless you want to experiment on the funds distribution mechanism\n(or unless you want to give away Ethers to HTK tokens holdes :P )\n\n\nFor Pre-ICO and ICO purposes, tokens transfer won't be allowed yet.\nThe only addresses that will be allowed to transfer tokens will be the ICO contract and The Honest Tree Game contract (for bounty)\nAfter ICO (December 30th 2020, you will be able to transfer tokens and sell them on any exchange)\nCheck that tokenTransfersAllowed=true;\n_________________________________________________\n\nAs written in the ICO webpage:\n- Total Suppply:  5,000,000\n- Pre-ICO and ICO: 85% = 4,250,000 (tranferred to the token ico crowdsale contract)\n- Team: 8% = 400,000, sent to the team address\n- Consultants: 4% = 200,000, sent to 3 addresses of our 3 Consultants\n- Bounty Programs: 6% = 150,000 sent to the bounty address\n\nOne example of the bounty program is the 500 free HTK tokens that all 100 fist players of The Honest Tree game will receive.\nThis 50,000 tokens will be sent from this contract directly to the Honest Tree Game contract. Read the code.\nThe rest 150,000 will be sent to an address from where we will only send these tokens to our next 3 projects\n(See www.honestlabs.win)\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n\nThe first project to implement this Funds Distribution Payment is The Honest Tree (visit www.honesttree.win)\n\nAll root node rewards are distibuted proportionally among Honest Tokens (HTK) holders!!!!\n\nBuy HTK tokens in: http://www.honestlabs.win\n\nIMPORTANT: In order for you to claim your Honest Tree root node's dividends, you must make sure to hold \nHonest Tree Tokens (HTTs) at the time of Honest Tree's root node's withdraw moment (first to be done on September 30th 2020,\nthen, once a month).\nAfter any of those moments, you can safely sell or transfer your tokens, even before having withdrawn your funds,\nand your past dividends will be honored. However, if you sell or transfer your HTT tokens, \nyour won't receive any future Honest Tree's dividends.\n*****\n\nWhat is ERC-2222 ?\nThe ERC-2222 standard enables the token to represent claims on future cash flow of an asset\nsuch as dividends, loan repayments, fee or revenue shares. This means that any incoming funds\ncan be distributed efficiently among large numbers of token holders.\nAnyone can deposit funds and token holders can withdraw their claims.\n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF ERC-222 STANDARD is that token holders CAN TRANSFER THEIR TOKENS\nat any time and can be sure that their PAST CLAIMS TO THE CASH FLOW of the token WILL BE HONORED.\n\nThe interface provides methods to deposit funds, to get information about available funds and to withdraw funds.\n\nIn this implementation, payments are made in Ethers, and token holders are seen as fractional\nowners of any future cash flow (mainly Honest Tree's root node's rewards, distributed very 90 days)\n\n\nFor more information see: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2222\nThis contact was based on the ERC-2222 implementation available in:\nhttps://github.com/atpar/funds-distribution-token\n\n*/\n\npragma solidity  ^0.6.2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontract HonestLabsToken is ERC20, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable{\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n\tusing SafeMathUint for uint256;\n\tusing SafeMathInt for int256;\n\t\n\t//see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1726#issuecomment-472352728\n\tuint256 constant internal pointsMultiplier = 2**128;\n\tuint256 internal pointsPerShare;\n\n\tmapping(address => int256) private pointsCorrection;\n\tmapping(address => uint256) private withdrawnFunds;\n\t\n    uint256 public creationDate;\n    \n    \n    uint256 public ICO_deadline;\n\tbool public tokenTransfersAllowed;\n\t\n    \n    \n    /*\n    HTK totalSupply will be 5000000 HTK (5,000,000)\n    \n    Distributed in the following way:\n    \n    * 4,250,000 (85%) for Pre-ICO and ICO Crowdsale.\n    * 400,000 (8%) for the developers team. \n    * 200,000 (6%) for consultants:\n        100,000 for consultant 1\n        50,000 for consultant 2\n        50,000 for consultant 3\n    * 150,000 for bounty\n        50,000 for The Honest Tree Ambassadors\n        50,000 for the Pharaoh\n        50,000 for the Exchange\n    */\n    \n    // Token ICO Crowdsale contract\n    address public tokenSaleContractAddress;\n    \n    // Crowdsale tokens are only minted once\n\tbool public tokenSaleContractAddressSetAndMinted; \n\t\n\t \n\t// Hence, the game contract should hold them\n\taddress public HonestTreeGameContractAddress;\n\t// Honest Tree Game tokens are only minted once\n\tbool public HonestTreeGameTokensMinted;\n\t\n\t\n\t// The Pharaoh Game will also have bounty tokens\n\taddress public PharaohGameContractAddress;\n\t// The Pharaoh Game tokens are only minted once\n\tbool public PharaohGameTokensMinted;\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    constructor() ERC20(\"Honest Token\", \"HTK\") public {\n        tokenTransfersAllowed=false;\n        tokenSaleContractAddressSetAndMinted=false;\n        HonestTreeGameTokensMinted=false;\n        _mint(address(0x013051d8496FD5f9C47fF29501D060060FC40c29), 100000 * 10**18); //Gemke 100,000\n        _mint(address(0x30840c0Bb874DFd0f0B7966BACbd5EFa61Dca00b), 50000 * 10**18); //Berend-jan 50,000\n        _mint(address(0x05cb1d3Fe87488E2CE35366F89E004e46E41C980), 50000 * 10**18); //Tyler 50,000\n        \n        _mint(address(0x9fdFEAb01A8B80AD6F505f4660AdB74A5C13F85B),400000* 10**18); // Team 400,000\n        \n        _mint(address(0xFEF2C35A11B59acbd9CBD9C6981Ec734DFF20A13),50000* 10**18); // 50,000 For the Exchange Bounty programs\n    \n        creationDate=now;\n        \n        //Epoch timestamp: 1609459199\n        // Date and time (GMT): Thursday, December 31, 2020 23:59:59 \n        ICO_deadline=1609459199;\n    }\n    \n    function setTokenSaleAddressAndMintTokens(address _tokenSaleContractAddress) \n        public\n        onlyOwner\n        nonReentrant\n        returns (bool) {\n            //Token Sale Contract is set only once.
