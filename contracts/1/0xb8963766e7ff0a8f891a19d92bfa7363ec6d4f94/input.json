No matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard \r\nfor all who hold power: you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with \r\na spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. \r\nTrade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and changing communities.\r\n\r\nWe are the party of Roosevelt. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. But \r\nwe will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and never as a patron. The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights \r\nand responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nWhat is that promise? I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. So \r\nlet there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. It is time for these settlements to stop. But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.\r\n\r\nBut what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, \r\nAmerica is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the Road Map are clear.\r\n\r\nHis father - my grandfather - was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have \r\nto come at the expense of my dreams; that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately \r\nhelp all of America prosper. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time. All these things must be done in partnership. \r\nThose are mutual interests.\r\n\r\nThe children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. He simply says \r\nto everyone in the room, \"I am here because of Ashley.\" We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the\r\nprofits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives \r\non tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work. Change means a tax code \r\nthat doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. Now is the time to finally keep the\r\npromise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement\r\nbrought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.\r\n\r\nBecause the Iraq war is not just a security problem, it's a moral problem. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day \r\nthan see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane \r\nstrikes and the floodwaters rise. It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.\r\n\r\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. \r\nIt came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for \r\ntheir third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. That is \r\nwhy we are forging service projects in America that bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\r\n\r\nThey cheered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when Dr. And meeting them won't be easy. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes \r\nalong racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of \r\nnations on nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nThis has bred more fear and mistrust. The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together.\r\n\r\nChange means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. There is no straight \r\nline to realize this promise.\r\n\r\nAnd God is still speaking. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service at Trinity: That has been my experience at \r\nTrinity. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. Freedom of religion is \r\ncentral to the ability of peoples to live together.\r\n\r\nThey would give me an African name, Barack, or \"blessed,\" believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. The press has scoured e\r\nvery exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. The enduring faith of \r\nover a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few.\r\n\r\nAnd as I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I \r\nthought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child. And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will \r\nrequire more than just money. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge \r\ndivides and unite in common effort. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete \r\nsteps to enable such progress. I know there are many - Muslim and non-Muslim - who question whether we can forge this new beginning.\r\n\r\nThat among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, \r\nwe saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the \r\nTaliban in Afghanistan. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. But I also know that human progress cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nAmerica! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion I do, if you feel the same \r\nhopefulness that I do - if we do what we must do, then I have no doubts that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine,\r\nthe people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country\r\nwill reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make \r\nof our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect. And for the sake of our economy, our \r\nsecurity, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. \r\nThe attacks of September 11th, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view\r\nIslam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights.\r\n\r\nWhile studying here, my father met my mother. I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my \r\ntwo precious daughters. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. Like the anger within the black community,\r\nthese resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles.\r\ntroops and civilians.\r\n\r\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for \r\ntheir families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, \r\nand earn the respect of the world. The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our \r\nobligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the poor.\r\n\r\nAnd they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. I'm talking about something more substantial. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering \r\nHis truth and carrying out His works. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. Tonight, more Americans are out \r\nof work and more are working harder for less. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought \r\ntogether and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.\r\n\r\nThe hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who \r\nembodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. \r\nAnd despite the costs involved, America's commitment will not weaken.\r\n\r\nThey have fought in our wars, served in government, stood for civil rights, started businesses, taught at our Universities, excelled in our sports arenas, won Nobel Prizes, \r\nbuilt our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.\r\n\r\nHall in East Moline, Ill.. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution - a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of \r\nequal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. He strengthened \r\nmy faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. That is true genius of this nation. It's time for us to change America. But we can only achieve it together.\r\n\r\nAnd so long as we're not doing everything in our personal and collective power to solve them, we know the conscience of our nation cannot rest. This is not to say that race \r\nhas not been an issue in the campaign. To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you. \r\nAs President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd until we stop the genocide that's being carried out in Darfur as I speak, our conscience cannot rest. You're on your own. So long as our relationship is defined by our \r\ndifferences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and \r\nprosperity. Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. But we can only achieve it together.\r\n\r\nI don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible \r\nhealth care for every single American.\r\n\r\nBut it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. In the Republicans who never thought\r\nthey'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I know there is debate about this issue.\r\n\r\nHe does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. But that is not yet the case.\r\n\r\nWe have real enemies in the world. They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was \r\nsystematically constricted. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations - those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or \r\nlanguishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together.\r\n\r\nImagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural without its reference to \"the judgments of the Lord.\" Or King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech without its reference to \"all of God's children.\" Or \r\nPresident Kennedy's Inaugural without the words, \"here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.\" At each of these junctures, by summoning a higher truth and embracing \r\na universal faith, our leaders inspired ordinary people to achieve extraordinary things. That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white, and \r\nthe concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of today's urban and rural communities. There is a young, twenty-three year old white woman named Ashley Baia \r\nwho organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nIt came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. They have fought in our wars, served in\r\ngovernment, stood for civil rights, started businesses, taught at our Universities, excelled in our sports arenas, won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and \r\nlit the Olympic Torch. But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America.\r\n\r\nWe worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. We were founded upon the ideal that all are \r\ncreated equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words - within our borders, and around the world.\r\n\r\nThat's not what I'm talking about. For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.\r\n\r\nAnd they want that choice. He was a good-looking kid, six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. Nor is it beyond the sea. Instead, they expressed a profoundly \r\ndistorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; \r\na view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful \r\nideologies of radical Islam. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.\r\n\r\nNow let me be clear. We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each \r\nmonth so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based\r\non what Islam is, not what it isn't. Much has been made of the fact that an African-American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President.\r\n\r\nSo doing the Lord's work is a thread that's run through our politics since the very beginning. God is still speaking. It is not up in heaven. As such, Reverend \r\nWright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to \r\nsolve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate \r\nchange; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.\r\n\r\nThat we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted at least, most of the time. This year, \r\nin this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the \r\nlegacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. I can assure you it is not. Our government should work for us, not against us. It is a \r\nsign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.\r\n\r\nMy father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect \r\nof American life. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions.\r\n\r\nPart of it's because of the so-called leaders of the Christian Right, who've been all too eager to exploit what divides us. That's why pastors, friends of\r\nmine like Rick Warren and T.D. Jakes and organizations like World Vision and Catholic Charities are wielding their enormous influence to confront poverty,\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the genocide in Darfur. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country.\r\n\r\nBut they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, \r\nand that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the \r\nUnited States of America. I learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen.\r\n\r\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. Let me be clear. \r\nThe children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. They have affiliates in many countries \r\nand are trying to expand their reach.\r\n\r\nIn this election, we offer that choice. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. \r\nFor eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. America, we cannot turn back. For centuries, black people in \r\nAmerica suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist \r\ncannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.\r\n\r\nAmong some Muslims, there is a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of another's. Those are mutual interests.\r\n\r\nWe cannot ignore that we have a right and a duty to protect our borders. We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, \r\nand appoint new Science Envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, and grow new crops.\r\n\r\nThey held vigils across this country when four little girls were killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church. This union may never be perfect, but generation after \r\ngeneration has shown that it can always be perfected. There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without \r\npreconditions on the basis of mutual respect. The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.\r\n\r\nGiven my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. \r\nYou can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with. \r\nAmericans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.\r\n\r\nGod bless you.\r\n\r\n*/"}}}
