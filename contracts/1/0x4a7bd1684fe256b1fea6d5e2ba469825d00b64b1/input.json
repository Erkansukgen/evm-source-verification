Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n * \n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.\n * \n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\n     */\n    modifier initializer() {\n        require(_initializing || _isConstructor() || !_initialized, \"Initializable: contract is already initialized\");\n\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = true;\n            _initialized = true;\n        }\n\n        _;\n\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Returns true if and only if the function is running in the constructor\n    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {\n        // extcodesize checks the size of the code stored in an address, and\n        // address returns the current address.
