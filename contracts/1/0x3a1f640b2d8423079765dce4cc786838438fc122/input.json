Lifetime passive income!\n\n*   The only one where you can make YOUR OWN COSTUMIZED REFERAL CODES. Totally free!\n\nSee http://www.honesttree.win, http://www.htree.win or http://www.honestlabs.win for more information.\nJoin our Telegram groups: https://t.me/HonestTree and https://t.me/HonestLabs\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nHow does it works:\n\n- Players get refered\n- Players pay a one-time fee: 0.04 ETH for basic program.\n- Players become a node of a basic general Tree (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29\n\n- Players can invite new players and build more branches and different levles. THERE IS NO LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PER LEVEL\n\n- Basic program allow you to erarn from unlimited children up to the 2nd level\n\n- You can make your own costumized referal codes!!!!!\n\n- Your first child pays 100% back your investment!\n\n================================\n    ACTIVE INCOME \n================================\n\n- Fees are distributed in 4 different rewards:\n    -   40% to 1st level up parent\n    -   25% to 2nd level up parent \n    -   15% to 3rd level up parent if 3rd level up parent is Premium\n    -   20% to Always distributed among previous players in the game!! Lifetime passive income!\n    \n- Who is my 1st down level?\n    Your 1st down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of your referral codes. \n    \n- What do I get from my 2nd down level children?\n    Your first child pays you 100%, ALL THE REST pay you 40%!!\n    \n- Who is my 2nd down level?\n    Your 2nd down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of yours 1st level down children's referal link. \n    Your 2nd level children are like your grand-children!\n    \n- What do I get from my 2nd down level children?\n    You get 25% of ALL of THEM. NO LIMITS! \n    \n    \n- Who is my 3rd down level?\n    In your 3rd down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of yours 2nd level down children's referal link. \n    Your 3RD level children are like your grand-grand-children!\n    \n- What do I get from my 3rd down level children?\n    You get 15% from ALL OF THEM ONLY if your are PREMIUM\n    \n\n================================\n    PREMIUM PLAN\n================================\n\n- Premium plan cost 0.5 ETH\n\n- Premium players unblock their 3rd level rewards for lifetime!\n\n- Where is my premium fee going (0.5 EHT)?\n    This smart contract distribute your Premium fee in the following perentages:\n    * 25% to yout 1st level up parent if he/she is Premium\n    * 10% to yout 2nd level up parent if he/she is Premium\n    * 25% to a Contest Pool. We are launching one contest every 15 days. This pool pays the winners.\n    These contest are based on number of referrals, amount of ETH collected in an specific time range, etc.\n    * 40% to marketing and bounty programs. We are giving away ETH to the bests youtube Video, the funniest picture with your community, the better article.\n        We are anouncint in our Telegram group!\n\n\n\nRoot node's earnings:\n- Root node rewards are accumulated and can only be transfered to Honest Token smart contract every 15 days.\n- The Honest Token (HTK) smart contract distribute dividends among token holders.\n- The maximum frecuency of 15 days is chosen in order to give certainty to token holders on the real value of the token,\n    so they can profit by speculation\n\nWhen does my investment is payed and I start earning money????\n\n    - If you are Basic player; when you have 3 players under you.\n    \n    - If you payed to be Premium, when you have between 67 and 100 players in your 3rd level\n        (depending on if they payed early bird fee or not). This means that in average, every\n        child player should have invited 4.06-4.64 players each. It's not a lot. Very possible!\n        \n        \n================================\n    PASSIVE INCOME \n================================\n\nYOU NEED AT LEAST ONE CHILD TO EARN PASSIVE INCOME!!!! READ BELOW\n\n20% of every player is distributed among previous players in the Tree.\nHow is this done?\nWe are introducint the Honest Tree Token (HTT), which is a  ERC20 compatible token with the ERC2222 fund distribution protocol.\n\n- What does mean ERC20? This means that you can exchange it and sell them buy more tokens at any exchange like Uniswap or even using TrustWallet or Metamask directly\n\n- What does mean ERC2222? This means that if you hold the token, you will get all passive income that is distributed among token holders.\n\n- How do I get passive income? Three things must happen:\n\n    0. You need to be in the game with at least one player under you (see below)\n\n    1.- Someone or more than one people needs to regiter to the game... \n    If you come first, you'll earn more, because the funds will be distributed among less people!\n    When this happens, all 20% fees are implicitly collected by the smart contract.\n    \n    2.- Someone needs to call the distributePassiveIncome()  function . We use a separate funcion because is not optimal to call it for every 0.008 ETH\n        Anyone can call the function, at anytime, even for 0.008 ETH, you'll just use gas for low distribution. Better wait for bigger distribution.\n    \n    3.- Your balance will be updated and you can call the withdrarPlayer() function directly on the contract or using the webpage.\n    \n    4.- Then we start with step 1 again :P\n    \n- When do I get the ERC20 / ERC2222 Hoenst Tree Token (HTT) ???\n    In order to avoid gas usage, the tokens will be minted when your first child gets registered.\n    His/hers registration cost less gas than later children, so we decided to put this function call here.\n    This means that you need AT LEAST ONE CHILD TO EARN PASSIVE INCOME!!!!\n        \nSee http://www.HonestTree.win for more information\nWrite to contact@honestlabs.win\nOr just join hour Telegram groups in: https://t.me/HonestTree and https://t.me/HonestLabs\n\n                                               |\n                                              -x-\n                                               |\n              v .   ._, |_  .,\n           `-._\\/  .  \\ /    |/_\n               \\\\  _\\, y | \\//\n         _\\_.___\\\\, \\\\/ -.\\||\n           `7-,--.`._||  / / ,\n           /'     `-. `./ / |/_.'\n                     |    |//\n                     |_    /\n                     |-   |\n                     |   =|\n                     |    |\n--------------------/ ,  . \\--------._\n\n\n  \n\nascii tree taken from: https://ascii.co.uk/art/tree\n\n*/\n\n\n// File: contracts/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\n// Licence: MIT\n\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n\n/**\n * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow\n * checks.\n *\n * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow.

THERE IS NO LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PER LEVEL\n\n- Basic program allow you to erarn from unlimited children up to the 2nd level\n\n- You can make your own costumized referal codes!!!!!\n\n- Your first child pays 100% back your investment!\n\n================================\n    ACTIVE INCOME \n================================\n\n- Fees are distributed in 4 different rewards:\n    -   40% to 1st level up parent\n    -   25% to 2nd level up parent \n    -   15% to 3rd level up parent if 3rd level up parent is Premium\n    -   20% to Always distributed among previous players in the game!! Lifetime passive income!\n    \n- Who is my 1st down level?\n    Your 1st down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of your referral codes. \n    \n- What do I get from my 2nd down level children?\n    Your first child pays you 100%, ALL THE REST pay you 40%!!\n    \n- Who is my 2nd down level?\n    Your 2nd down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of yours 1st level down children's referal link. \n    Your 2nd level children are like your grand-children!\n    \n- What do I get from my 2nd down level children?\n    You get 25% of ALL of THEM. NO LIMITS! \n    \n    \n- Who is my 3rd down level?\n    In your 3rd down level are ALL the players that enter to the game using one of yours 2nd level down children's referal link. \n    Your 3RD level children are like your grand-grand-children!\n    \n- What do I get from my 3rd down level children?\n    You get 15% from ALL OF THEM ONLY if your are PREMIUM\n    \n\n================================\n    PREMIUM PLAN\n================================\n\n- Premium plan cost 0.5 ETH\n\n- Premium players unblock their 3rd level rewards for lifetime!\n\n- Where is my premium fee going (0.5 EHT)?\n    This smart contract distribute your Premium fee in the following perentages:\n    * 25% to yout 1st level up parent if he/she is Premium\n    * 10% to yout 2nd level up parent if he/she is Premium\n    * 25% to a Contest Pool. We are launching one contest every 15 days. This pool pays the winners.\n    These contest are based on number of referrals, amount of ETH collected in an specific time range, etc.\n    * 40% to marketing and bounty programs. We are giving away ETH to the bests youtube Video, the funniest picture with your community, the better article.\n        We are anouncint in our Telegram group!\n\n\n\nRoot node's earnings:\n- Root node rewards are accumulated and can only be transfered to Honest Token smart contract every 15 days.\n- The Honest Token (HTK) smart contract distribute dividends among token holders.\n- The maximum frecuency of 15 days is chosen in order to give certainty to token holders on the real value of the token,\n    so they can profit by speculation\n\nWhen does my investment is payed and I start earning money????\n\n    - If you are Basic player; when you have 3 players under you.\n    \n    - If you payed to be Premium, when you have between 67 and 100 players in your 3rd level\n        (depending on if they payed early bird fee or not). This means that in average, every\n        child player should have invited 4.06-4.64 players each. It's not a lot. Very possible!\n        \n        \n================================\n    PASSIVE INCOME \n================================\n\nYOU NEED AT LEAST ONE CHILD TO EARN PASSIVE INCOME!!!! READ BELOW\n\n20% of every player is distributed among previous players in the Tree.\nHow is this done?\nWe are introducint the Honest Tree Token (HTT), which is a  ERC20 compatible token with the ERC2222 fund distribution protocol.\n\n- What does mean ERC20? This means that you can exchange it and sell them buy more tokens at any exchange like Uniswap or even using TrustWallet or Metamask directly\n\n- What does mean ERC2222? This means that if you hold the token, you will get all passive income that is distributed among token holders.\n\n- How do I get passive income? Three things must happen:\n\n    0. You need to be in the game with at least one player under you (see below)\n\n    1.- Someone or more than one people needs to regiter to the game... \n    If you come first, you'll earn more, because the funds will be distributed among less people!\n    When this happens, all 20% fees are implicitly collected by the smart contract.\n    \n    2.- Someone needs to call the distributePassiveIncome()  function . We use a separate funcion because is not optimal to call it for every 0.008 ETH\n        Anyone can call the function, at anytime, even for 0.008 ETH, you'll just use gas for low distribution. Better wait for bigger distribution.\n    \n    3.- Your balance will be updated and you can call the withdrarPlayer() function directly on the contract or using the webpage.\n    \n    4.- Then we start with step 1 again :P\n    \n- When do I get the ERC20 / ERC2222 Hoenst Tree Token (HTT) ???\n    In order to avoid gas usage, the tokens will be minted when your first child gets registered.\n    His/hers registration cost less gas than later children, so we decided to put this function call here.\n    This means that you need AT LEAST ONE CHILD TO EARN PASSIVE INCOME!!!!\n        \nSee http://www.HonestTree.win for more information\nWrite to contact@honestlabs.win\nOr just join hour Telegram groups in: https://t.me/HonestTree and https://t.me/HonestLabs\n\n                                               |\n                                              -x-\n                                               |\n              v .   ._, |_  .,\n           `-._\\/  .  \\ /    |/_\n               \\\\  _\\, y | \\//\n         _\\_.___\\\\, \\\\/ -.\\||\n           `7-,--.`._||  / / ,\n           /'     `-. `./ / |/_.'\n                     |    |//\n                     |_    /\n                     |-   |\n                     |   =|\n                     |    |\n--------------------/ ,  . \\--------._\n\n\n  \n\nascii tree taken from: https://ascii.co.uk/art/tree\n\n*/\n\n\ncontract HonestTreeGame  is ERC20, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable{\n    \n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n\tusing SafeMathUint for uint256;\n\tusing SafeMathInt for int256;\n\t\n\t// For ERC222 Fund distribution Protocol\n\t//see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1726#issuecomment-472352728\n\tuint256 constant internal pointsMultiplier = 2**128;\n\tuint256 internal pointsPerShare;\n\tmapping(address => int256) private pointsCorrection;\n\n    uint32 public sum_players;\n    uint32 public sum_paid_players; //Playes who their fee has been distributed (not first child, for example, not ambassador)\n    uint32 public sum_premium_players;\n    \n    uint256 public distributed_passive_rewards;\n    \n    mapping(address => uint32) public first_num; // Numer of children in the first down level for a given player\n    mapping(address => uint32) public second_num; // Numer of children in the first down level for a given player\n    mapping(address => uint32) public third_num; // Numer of children in the first down level for a given player\n    mapping(address => uint32) public lost_pm; //Number of children lost for not being premium yet :O for a given player\n    mapping(address => uint32) public id; // The id of the player\n    mapping(address => address) private parent; // The parent of a given player\n    mapping(address => bool) public is_premium; // Is the player Premium?\n    mapping(address => string[]) private my_aliases;\n    \n    // Premium fee is distributed among 1st and 2nd level parent:\n    // This  mapping keeps track of these fees, rewards from children that have become Premium\n    // This is different than third level basic rewards\n    mapping(address => uint256) public premium_rewards; \n    \n    \n    mapping(address => uint256) private withdrawnActive; //Active Income Already Withdrawn\n\tmapping(address => uint256) private withdrawnPassive;// Passive Income Already Withdrawn\n    \n    \n    mapping(uint => address) private ids; // For default referals links\n    mapping(string => address) private aliases; // For customized referals links\n    \n    uint32 private DAY_IN_SECONDS;\n    uint32 public ambassadors;\n    uint32 public free_premium;\n\n    uint256 public last_withdraw_date;\n    \n    uint256 public current_pool;\n    uint256 public current_bounty;\n    address private root_node;\n    address public marketing_add;\n    address public pool_contest_add;\n    \n    constructor(address _root_node) ERC20(\"Honest Tree Token\", \"HTT\") public{\n\n        DAY_IN_SECONDS=86400;\n        //Root node registration\n        root_node=_root_node;\n        parent[_root_node]=_root_node;\n        is_premium[_root_node]=true;\n        ids[0]=_root_node;\n        sum_players=1;\n        free_premium=1;\n        ambassadors=1;\n        \n        // This will be used for marketing proposals and bounty program.
