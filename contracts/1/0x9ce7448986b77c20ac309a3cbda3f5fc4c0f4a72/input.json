WHEAT accrues staking rewards, increases coverage capacity on nexus mutual, and circumvents the mandatory staking lockup period. \r\n\r\nWHEAT FARM Tokenized Coverage is a wrapper for WHEAT Mutual coverage with many security improvements over the original tokens. \r\n\r\nWHEAT Staking Pool allows users to stake WHEAT to sell coverage and earn yield through WHEAT's Smart Cover System and Shield Vaults. \r\n\r\nWHEATCore Smart Cover System is our first product that facilitates smart yet simple, dynamic, pay-as-you-go WHEAT Mutual coverage on your funds to protect them against smart contract risks.\r\n\r\nWHEAT Vaults are protected vaults for LP tokens with autopayments, powered by arCore. Users can deposit their LP tokens and enjoy fully or partially collateralized smart contract insurance coverage. Cover fees are subtracted from the yield generated from pool fees - that means you never have to pay manually or deposit funds up front.\r\n\r\nUniswap LP token staking vault\r\n\r\nSushiswap LP token staking vault\r\n\r\nMore soon\r\n\r\nWHEATDAO is sufficiently decentralized at launch while maintaining organizational agility. The proxies are controlled with a new hybrid system. There is a timelock owned contract which controls everything with two owners: a team multisig and a full DAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return WHEAT\r\n\r\nThe WHEAT FARM vault will maintain a reservoir to provide liquidity (for ETH/WHEAT), which refreshes the WHEAT balance every week on Mondays (to coincide with Nexus staking rewards distribution). In addition to the WHEAT added through rebalancing, all deposits from users during the week will also be kept in the reserve and serve to provide additional liquidity until the next Monday when retaking occurs. Funds may be withdrawn at any time given sufficient liquidity is available. \r\n\r\nThe amount of WHEAT FARM to keep in the reserve is calculated as a percentage of the total Assets Under Management (WHEAT). The default value at start will be set at 10% WHEAT. Adjustments can be made through governance as required.\r\n\r\nf = Amount of funds to keep in the contract in reserve\r\n\r\nWHEAT = Total amount of funds under the vault's control\r\n\r\nr = The percentage, in a decimal format, of WJEAT to keep in reserve each week\r\n\r\nf = r * WHEAT\r\nf=râˆ— WHEAT\r\nIf this reserve completely runs out of funds, users may not withdraw until next week when the newly unstaked WHEAT will refill the reserve.\r\n\r\nClaims Process\r\nIn the case of a successful claim and payout on a contract that WHEAT was staking on, the vault will lose its stake (proportionally based on the share of the staking pool and the size of the claim) resulting in a lower conversion rate of WHEAT. \r\n\r\nIn the case where a claim is made and is anticipated to succeed, informed users may withdraw their WHEAT FARM in return for WHEAT from the reserve. The maximum drain is limited by reservoir size and market forces will equalize the price of WHEAT FARM over time.\r\nAdditional controls such as layer 2 insurance solution and automatic rebalancing of WHEAT pricing to reflect losses due to potentially successful claims will be introduced in the future to protect investors from risk of loss.\r\n\r\nWithdrawal limit on swaps from the WHEAT Vault\r\nThe maximum withdrawals of WHEAT per refill cycle is limited to the size of the reservoir plus any deposits made through the cycle, which are not staked until the end of that cycle. The reserve size can be optimized to ensure users have sufficient liquidity throughout the cycle, leave enough for staking to maximize rewards, and limit large drawdowns from the vault; this balance will be adjusted through governance as needed.\r\n\r\nIn reality, we anticipate very little conversion of WHEAT to WHEAT FARM since users can sell their WHEAT directly for ETH through the various LPs.\r\n\r\n*/\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply() external view returns(uint);\r\n\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view
