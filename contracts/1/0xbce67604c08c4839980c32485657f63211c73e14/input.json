DIPEX can also prevent price manipulation or faked trading volume through wash trading, and are more anonymous than exchanges which implement know your customer (KYC) requirements.\r\n\r\n✅ ERC20 / ERC20 Pairs\r\n\r\n   In DIPEX, any ERC20 token can be pooled directly with any other ERC20 token. Wrapped Ether (WETH) is used instead of native ETH in the core contracts, although end users can still use ETH through helper contracts.\r\n   In DIPEX, all liquidity pools are between ETH and a single ERC20 token. Having a constant numeraire provides a nice UX advantage — users can swap any ERC20 for any other ERC20 by routing through ETH. Since ETH is the most liquid Ethereum-based asset, and does not introduce any new platform risk.\r\n\r\n   However, the introduction of ERC20 token/ERC20 token pools in Uniswap V2 can be useful for liquidity providers, who can maintain more diverse ERC20 token denominated positions, without mandatory exposure to ETH.\r\n\r\n✅ Price Oracles\r\n\r\n  DIPEX implements new functionality that enables highly decentralized and manipulation-resistant on-chain price feeds. This is achieved by measuring prices when they are expensive to manipulate, and cleverly accumulating historical data. This allows external smart contracts to create gas-efficient, time-weighted averages of DIPEX prices across any time interval.\r\n\r\n   On-chain price feeds are a critical component for many decentralized financial applications including those similar to derivatives, lending, margin trading, prediction markets and more. Despite closely tracking the real-world price most of the time, OTHER DEXes cannot be used safely as a price oracle because the price can move significantly in a short period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Flash Swaps\r\n\r\n   DIPEX flash swaps allow you to withdraw as much as you want of any ERC20 token on DIPEX at no upfront cost and do anything you want with them (execute arbitrary code), provided that by the end of the transaction execution, you either:\r\npay for all ERC20 tokens withdrawn\r\npay for a percentage of ERC20 tokens and return the rest\r\nreturn all ERC20 tokens withdrawn\r\n\r\n  Liquidity provider fees are enforced by subtracting 0.3% from all input amounts, even if the input ERC20 tokens are being returned as part of a flash swap.\r\n\r\nOn-chain order books\r\n\r\nIn some decentralized exchanges, everything is done on-chain (we’ll talk about hybridized approaches shortly). Every order (as well as alteration and cancellation) is written to the blockchain. This is arguably the most transparent approach, as you’re not trusting a third party to relay the orders to you, and there’s no way to obfuscate them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it’s also the most impractical. Since you’re asking every node on the network to record the order forever, you end up paying a fee. You need to wait until a miner adds your message to the blockchain, meaning the experience can be cumbersome, too. \r\n\r\nSome identify front running as a flaw in this model. Front running occurs in markets when an insider is aware of a pending transaction and uses that information to place a trade before the transaction is processed. The front runner, therefore, benefits from information not known to the public. Generally speaking, this is illegal. \r\n\r\nOf course, if everything is published on a global ledger, there’s no opportunity to front run in the traditional sense. That said, a different kind of attack can be deployed: one where a miner sees the order before it’s confirmed, and ensures that their own order gets added to the blockchain first.\r\n\r\nExamples of on-chain order book models include the Stellar and Bitshares DEXs.\r\n\r\nOff-chain order books\r\nOff-chain order book DEXs are still decentralized in some regards, but they’re admittedly more centralized than the previous entry. Instead of every order being posted to the blockchain, they’re hosted somewhere. \r\n\r\nWhere? That depends. You could have a centralized entity completely in charge of the order book. If that entity is malicious, then they could game the markets to an extent (i.e., by front running or misrepresenting orders). However, you would still benefit from non-custodial storage.\r\n\r\nThe 0x protocol for ERC-20 and other tokens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain is a good example of this. Rather than act as a singular DEX, it provides a framework for parties known as “relayers” to manage off-chain order books. Leveraging 0x smart contracts and some other tools, hosts can tap into a combined liquidity pool and relay orders between users. The trade is only executed on-chain once the parties are matched.\r\n\r\nThese approaches are superior from a usability perspective than those that rely on on-chain order books. They don’t face the same constraints in terms of speed, as they don’t use the blockchain as much. Still, the trade must be settled on it, so the off-chain order book model is still inferior to centralized exchanges in terms of speed.\r\n\r\nImplementations of off-chain order books include Binance DEX, IDEX, and EtherDelta.\r\n*/\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply() external view returns(uint);\r\n\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external
